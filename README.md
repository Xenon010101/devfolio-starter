## 🐛 Known Bugs & Open Issues

These bugs are **intentionally left in the code** for contributors to find and fix as part of **GSSoC 2026**. Each is a real, impactful bug — not a typo.

| # | File | Description | Difficulty |
|---|------|-------------|------------|
| 1 | `index.html` | `<meta name="viewport">` is missing its `content` attribute — page is **not mobile responsive** | 🟢 Easy |
| 2 | `index.html` | Hamburger `<button>` has no `onclick` — but `main.js` attaches the listener; **the bug is in `main.js`** (see #7 below) | 🟢 Easy |
| 3 | `index.html` | Project filter: the `active` class is on the **"JavaScript"** button, not "All" | 🟢 Easy |
| 4 | `index.html` | Skill bar `<div>`s have `style="width: 0%"` hardcoded — the JS observer sets `data-width` correctly but the CSS transition won't work without fixing the initial HTML | 🟡 Medium |
| 5 | `index.html` | Email `<input>` has `type="text"` — should be `type="email"` for proper browser validation | 🟢 Easy |
| 6 | `index.html` | Footer copyright year is **hardcoded as 2023** — should dynamically show the current year via JS | 🟢 Easy |
| 7 | `js/main.js` | `navLinks.classList.toggle()` is called **without the class name argument** — hamburger menu never opens | 🟢 Easy |
| 8 | `js/main.js` | Counter animation `increment` is `target / 10` — with `setInterval` at 80ms this gives imprecise jumpy counts; should use `Math.ceil(target / 50)` or similar | 🟡 Medium |
| 9 | `js/main.js` | Email validation regex `/@/` only checks for `@` — accepts `abc@` as valid. Should be a proper email regex | 🟡 Medium |
| 10 | `js/animations.js` | Page fade-in doesn't animate — `transition` is never set before `opacity` changes, so the body just snaps to visible | 🟡 Medium |
